		<h1>COMP20 Security &amp; Privacy Assessment</h1>
                <p>By <a href='http://edobranov.github.io/'>Evgeni Dobranov</a> â€¢ 4/26/2016</p>

		<hr><h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>This assessment thoroughly tests the security issues behind the
		<a href="http://tuftsdev.github.io/WebProgramming/assignments/a3.html">Historic Landmarks (COMP20 Assignment 3)</a>
		application developed by Joshua Port. This web application receives data from the user in the form of a login name,
		and longitude and latitude coordinates. It displays an HTML landing page with recent logins, and can also return
		JSON data of either the logins of a certain user, or nearby landmarks in North America. The JSON of the nearby landmarks
		is incorported into <a href="http://tuftsdev.github.io/WebProgramming/assignments/a2.html">Assignment 2</a> in order
		to display nearby landmarks using custom markers on Google Maps.</p>
		<p>In order to exploit security issues, I will be manipulating and tampering with the input data in "clever" ways -
		that is to say, in ways that one would normally hear about in typical XSS attacks.</p>
		
                <hr><h2>Methodology</h2>
		<p>The metholodogy I used (in accordance to the assignment requirements) was to first do black-box testing and
		then do white-box testing. Initially I used my own tools (namely a simple Python server, Curl, Postman, etc.) to
		POST to the server using malicious credentials. Then I perused through the source code and looked at the way various
		POST inputs were used as parameters for interaction with other components (like the MongoDB database), which allowed
		for more involved security exploits.
                
                <hr><h2>Abstract of Findings</h2>
		<p>All of the issues essentially fall under the category of using clever "hacker-like" input that a computer cannot
		distinguish as benevolent, good-natured input and malicious code to run. This means that too much trust was placed
		in what the user can input. For example, the user can input simple coding "tags" that the computer mindlessly
		interprets as "print this to the screen". Of course, one can imagine various pictures and videos that would make
		a lot of people very angry...</p>
		
                <hr><h2>Issues Found</h2>
                <ol>
                
                        <li><b>HTML Code Injection</b></li>
                        <ul>
                                <li>Affects landing page (GET)</li>
				<li>Severity: <div id="severity">Medium - High</div></li>
				<li>I found this issue using the more fundamental theory behind HTML. I know that the login name
				is displayed as plain text, so putting in HTML code for the username itself will render that HTML
				code. The key to why this works is because the browser cannot know how to render things like tags
				differently from simple characters. It simply interprets the output string as "HTML code", and will
				render what there is to render as code. <br>
				Things like malicious images and videos can easily be injected into the website as well, beyond annoying
				colors and large, scary words. This can obviously cause a lot of issues with inappropriate content.
				Luckily, I only get as malicious as bunnies.<br><br>
				<img src="bunnies.jpg" alt="bunnies"><br>
				The code I inputted was a simple <div id="codesmall">&lt;img src="..." alt="..."&gt;</div> instead of inputting
				a typical login, like a name. For this in particular, I used the Curl tool to POST to the Herokuapp server:
				<div id="codesmall">curl --data "login=&lt;img src="http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0224/1915/files/bunny.jpg?22110" alt="bunnies"&gt;&amp;lat=71&amp;lng=41" http://dry-anchorage-34836.herokuapp.com/sendLocation</div></li>
				<li>Fortunately, this issue in particular isn't too difficult to solve in a sense. You'd just have to
				filter all non-alphanumeric characters out of the input, using a simple regex (regular expression)
				like <div id="codesmall">[a-zA-Z0-9]</div></li>
                        </ul>
                        
			<br>
			
                        <li><b>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</b></li>
                        <ul>
				<li>Affects landing page (GET)</li>
				<li>Severity: <div id="severity">Medium - High</div></li>
                                <li>This issue encompasses the idea of using the &lt;script&gt; tag to dynamically tamper with a website.
				Much like with code injection above, a script like the one below could be sent through POST: <br>
				<br><div id="code">&lt;script&gt; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while(1) {<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;alert("Mwahaha!"); <br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>&lt;/script&gt;</div><br>
				<img src="alert.jpg" alt="alert"><br>
				This code sample, for example, will cause the browser to produce indefinitely many alert messages
				until the user stops them. It freezes up the whole website and causes it to become unusable. It also
				prevents the remainder of the website from rendering, depending on where the script is executed.<br>
				This could get particularly dangerous for reasons besides resource-hogging. One situation could be a script
				that causes the background to rapidly change between bright colors, which could be a serious
				problem for those with epilepsy.</li>
				<li>Since XSS falls under code injection, the solution to this security issue would be the same as the
				one prior to it. That is, including a regex (regular expression) to filter out all non-alphanumeric
				characters from the user's input, like <div id="codesmall">[a-zA-Z0-9]</div></li>
                        </ul>
			
			<br>
			
			<li><b>NoSQL (MongoDB) Query Injection</b></li>
			<ul>
				<li>Affects the <div id="codesmall">/checkins.json?login=</div> &nbsp;route (entering query string via the URL bar)</li>
				<li>Severity: <div id="severity">High</div></li>
				<li>This is a major, major security problem. First off, MongoDB is a NoSQL type of database, which is a
				deviation from SQL databases in the sense that they are non-relational and more scalable. For my goal,
				I'm only really concerned with the fact that they use different types of querying parameters. So, let's
				say I wanted to retrieve all non-blank usernames - which is to say - essentially all of them. The vulnerability
				arises from the fact that entries in a MongoDB collection are queried via the find() command. In this case,
				the exact query is <div id="codesmall">collection.find( { login: login_name } )</div>, where login_name is
				extracted from the URL bar via <div id="codesmall">var login_name = request.query.login;</div><br>
				The only required part now is to figure out how to query the logins in such a way. According to this
				<a href='http://blog.websecurify.com/2014/08/hacking-nodejs-and-mongodb.html'>blog post</a>, for the Node.js
				framework (on which this project is built on), the query syntax <div id="codesmall">login[$ne]</div> is a way
				to make a JavaScript object that looks like this:<br><br>
				<div id="code">{<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"login" : { "$ne" : "" }<br>
				}</div><br>
				This, when inputted into the find() command above, will query all login names not equal to an empty string,
				which looks like this when used on the web application:<br><br>
				<img src="login.jpg" alt="login">
				Given that all the logins are already available on the default route, this might not be considered such a big flaw,
				but if that route did not exist, then it would be a huge vulnerability... *cough*
				<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2014/01/10/the-target-hack-gets-worse-phone-numbers-addresses-of-up-to-70-million-customers-leaked/">
				Target</a> *cough*
				<li>Luckily, the solution for this is also relatively simplistic it seems. Thanks to a
				<a href="https://github.com/vkarpov15/mongo-sanitize">good citizen</a>, all you'd have to do is run
				<div id="codesmall">npm install mongo-sanitize</div> in your Node.js folder, add it to your dependencies in
				your package.json file, and include <div id="codesmall">var sanitize = require('mongo-sanitize');</div>
				at the top of your index.js file. From that point on, you'd just have to call <div id="codesmall">sanitize()</div>
				with whatever string you'd like to rid of possibly query injection as the parameter.</li>
				
			</ul>
			
			<br>
			
			<li><b>Faulty Longitude and Latitude Parameter Storage</b></li>
			<ul>
				<li>Affects landing page (GET) and internal MongoDB database</li>
				<li>Severity: <div id="severity">Low</div></li>
				<li>This issue becomes evident when entering longitude and latitude coordinates that are not numbers,
				like "cookie" or mixtures of numeric and non-numeric characters, like "1/0". While a valid JSON is returned
				in the form of <div id="codesmall">{"error":"Error with find() in landmarks collection"}</div>, the
				value is still stored in the MongoDB database and essentially represents junk data. It can become easy
				to flood the database with this, essentially making it harder for someone who would want to use the
				returned JSON for a different purpose.<br><br>
				<img src="nan.jpg" alt="nan"><br></li>
				<li>The primary fix behind this is changing the conditions for which a parameter is stored. As it remains,
				a parameter is only rejected if it is null via the code snippet:<br><br>
				<div id="codelong">if (login == null || lat == null || lng == null) {<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;response.send('{"error":"Whoops, something is wrong with your data!"}');<br>
				}</div><br>
				The code then proceeds to insert the data into the database anyway. Instead of checking just for null values
				(which is not desireable since the coordinates {"cookie", "lettuce"} are indeed non-null), it'd be much better
				to use the isNaN() operator. That is, changing the code above to the following would fix the issue:<br><br>
				<div id="codelong">if (login == null || isNaN(lat) || isNaN(lng)) {<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;response.send('{"error":"Whoops, something is wrong with your data!"}');<br>
				}</div></li><br>
				
			</ul>
                        
                </ol>
                
                <hr><h2>Conclusion</h2>
		As a whole, the security flaws and privacy vulnerabilities listed above are pretty serious. From code and query injection, to
		XSS, the website can be compromised in a number of ways. For the future, the easiest way to deal with these issues is to
		leave the system / web application open in only as many ways as is necessary. Additionally, it can be very beneficial to
		just sit down and imagine what the user can input - the type of characters, links to pictures and other things, various
		strings that you've already coded into your application, etc. As a solution, it's best to just restrict these things using
		regular expressions and modules created exactly for this purpose. If I had to estimate, this fix would cost around $100
		in addition to the tasks required to thoroughly test all vulnerability points.
