**1)** I found 3 major issues and 1 minor one, which seems to be the extent of the larger problems this assignment. Of course, there are always more bugs to be found, but I believe if these 4 are fixed, the application will be much harder to compromise.

**2)** I've worked on this assignment by myself, frequenting online documentation and forums. Thank you to this blog post for descriptions on the mysterious MongoDB querying structure (http://blog.websecurify.com/2014/08/hacking-nodejs-and-mongodb.html) and to Ming for helping me with the same issue.

**3)** I spent ~3 hours on this assignment.
