**1)** All aspects of the required assignment were implemented correctly (to my knowledge of course). One possible edit for the future is to make infoboxes and polylines automatically disappear when a new marker is clicked on. I wasn't quite sure how to do that, and figured it worked just fine as it is now :)

**2)** I've worked on this assignment by myself, looking up online documentation and forums (*a lot*). Here are the places from where I got code:
..* Haversine formula: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14560999/using-the-haversine-formula-in-javascript
..* XMLHttpRequest headers: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9713058/sending-post-data-with-a-xmlhttprequest
..* Ming's Google Maps examples: https://github.com/tuftsdev/WebProgramming/tree/gh-pages/examples/google_maps
..* Marker and InfoWindow help: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11106671/google-maps-api-multiple-markers-with-infowindows
..* Multiple markers: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7044587/adding-multiple-markers-with-infowindows-google-maps-api

..* Google Maps JS API documentation: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial#Audience

**3)** I spent ~5 hours on this assignment. Lots of tweaking around with asynchronous errors and things being accessed before they even render...
