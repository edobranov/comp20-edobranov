**1)**	All aspects of the required assignment were implemented correctly (to my
	knowledge of course). When changing browser widths, the correct part of the
	image is displayed on screen.
	
	The only slightly annoying part that each image is off by a couple of
	pixels, so there's a minute shift with each new image splice. This could be
	because of the image, but it's not worth the time to fix since that
	digresses from the point of this assignment. :v:

**2)**	I've worked on this assignment by myself, frequenting online documentation
	and forums.

3)	I spent ~1.5 hours on this assignment.
